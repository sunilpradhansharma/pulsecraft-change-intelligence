# PulseCraft — Planning Index

> **Purpose.** Single place to check *what has been decided, what is in flight, what is next, and where each artifact lives.*

## Current phase

**Phase:** Active implementation — schemas and config complete, agent authoring next.

**Last completed:** Prompt 05 (SignalScribe — first real LLM-backed agent; gates 1, 2, 3; Claude Sonnet 4.6; eval script; CLI --real-signalscribe flag).

Planning phases P0–P2 are complete. The prompt-driven build sequence is at prompt 05 of 14. Prompt 06 (BUAtlas agent) is next.

## Versioning approach

Prompts, schemas, configs, and decision criteria are versioned together. A change to any of them bumps a version and triggers re-eval. The audit log records which version of each was active for any given change event.
